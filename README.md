## Features

- **Rate Limiting:** Token bucket algorithm to control request rates per peer.
- **Link Quality Metrics:** Collect latency and packet loss data, calculate routing cost for smarter path selection.
- **Reliable Delivery:** Sequencing, acknowledgements, retransmission, and fragmentation for robust message delivery.
